To create a database for online food ordering application.

### Database purpose:
The purpose of the database is to maintain the data for an online food ordering application. It includes functionality of checking out the restaurants and related menu, filtering based on price, cuisine and ratings, ordering, delivery and payment. This database will be used by online food ordering application that acts as an interface between the customers and the restaurants.

### Business problems addressed:
* Allow the online application administrative staff, application development staff and restaurant administrative staff to generate descriptive reports.
*	Provide insight for restaurants to enhance their business (e.g. improve quality of food based on customer reviews, customize the food menu based on customer preferences)
*	Provide insight for application development staff to improvise the application.

### Business Rules:
* Each customer can place one or multiple orders from many restaurants.
*	Each restaurant will have many food items.
*	Each order will have one delivery staff assigned.
*	Each customer will have option to make payment by cash or by card.
*	Each customer will have an option to use promocode if applicable.
*	Each customer will have an option to provide ratings/reviews for the restaurant and the food items.

### Design Requirements:
*	Use Crow's Foot Notation.
*	Specify primary key fields in each table by specifying PK beside the fields.
*	Draw a line between tables to show the relationships between them. This line should be pointed directly to the fields in each table that are used to form the relationship.
*	Specify which table is on the one side and many side of the relationship by placing a crows foot notation next to the field where the line ends.
